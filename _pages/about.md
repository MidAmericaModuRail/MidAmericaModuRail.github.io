The Mid-America ModuRail Club was formed in 1994 by a group of persons with a common interest in railroads and model railroading. Over the years, the members have, as a group, applied their interests and various talents collectively to the planning, construction, improvement, and maintenance of a modular model railroad layout, which they operate for their own enjoyment. A number of times per year the Club also displays and operates the layout at public locations for the enjoyment of their families and friends and without charge to the general public, in hopes of furthering an interest in model railroading.
